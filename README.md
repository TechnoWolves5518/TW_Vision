# TW_Vision V1.0.0
## Developed by FRC Team 5518 TechnoWolves

* Set up PhotonVision with multiple cameras
* Use cameras to search for AprilTags
* Be able to see from code if your cameras can see any AprilTags
* Use readings from cameras to update robot pose


## How to Set Up TW_Vision
* Download the source code from our GitHub
* Add both Vision.java and Constants.java to src\main\java\frc\robot in your WPILib code. If you already have a Constants.java file, add the VisionSystem class to your Constants.java file, as shown in our constants file.
  * If your Constants.java file is giving errors, make sure you have all of the correct imports (see our file as an example).
